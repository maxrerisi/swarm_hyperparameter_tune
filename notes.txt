So we take two points, for simplicity, say each point is of the form (a, b, c, d)
create a triangle (or wtv its called in wtv-dim space)
say a1-a2, b1-b2, c1-c2, d1-d2
so for every a1-a2 direction in a, you need a b1-b2 direction in b
you establish a ratio (a1-a2)/(b1-b2) and then (a1-a2)/(c1-c2)

establish some formula from point one. so youre saying point 1 = (a, b, c, d)
you want to move to point 2 at a magnitude of 10

where 1 is where you start and 3 is the interim point along the way you want to go
so you basically say sqrt((a1-a3)^2 + (b1-b3)^2 + (c1-c3)^2 + (d1-d3)^2) = 10. You know what all the 1s are. 
you know that (a1-a3)/(b1-b3) = (a1-a2)/(b1-b2)
